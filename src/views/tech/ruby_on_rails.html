                    We worked with Idyllic Software for several months to help provide a much needed push in order to get to beta testing in a reasonable amount of time. They didn't disappoint. These guys are wicked smart as they worked diligently with a high degree of professionalism.

                    They are excellent problem solvers and made themselves available for regularly scheduled meetings, working sessions and consultation. It was really a pleasure to work with these gentlemen.
